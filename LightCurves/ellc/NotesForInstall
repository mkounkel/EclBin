1. Need fortran compiler.

Get binary installer from http://hpc.sourceforge.net (use gfortran link and follow instructions in the first paragraph)

2. pip install ellc  (https://pypi.org/project/ellc/)

3. also pip install emcee (https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/install/#using-pip)

and corner (https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

4. Use sample notebook to prepare light curve file in format desired by ellc_emcee 

5. Use V-K color (from Simbad) to estimate Teff of primary star. (edit notebook to do this?)

6. Use eclipse widths to estimate R_1/a (where R_1/a ~ width of eclipse in phase)

7. Use eclipse depths to estimate surface brightness ratios.  (dip_1 / dip_2 ~ sb_2 / sb_1)

8. Use eclipse phases to estimate eccentricity: e ~ phase_diff_max - phase_diff_min
8.1 Print out T_O of primary eclipse for table, and for Chase to use as TO in her RV fits.

9. save all these parameters in a log file

10. start ellc_emcee with a command like:

./ellc_emcee

Use log file to guide responses to user questions.

let run!
